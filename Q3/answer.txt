For Salt-and-pepper noise, Median filter is the best, and the difference among 3 different sizes of kernel effects little in this filter.
However, in other filters, larger the kernel, better the result.

For Gaussian noise, it's hard to evaluate their performance. 
It seems that filter that eliminate more noise has to cause more ambiguity to the output.
Gauss-median filter does well in restore details with least ambiguity, but it leaves some white areas.
Gaussfilter and gaussianboxfilter are similar, and Gaussianboxfilter makes the picture more smooth.
And the performance of filter increases with kernels' size increases.
